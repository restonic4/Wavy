# ⚠️ Project Status & Warnings

Welcome! This project began as an experimental proof of concept developed primarily with AI agents to test the feasibility of the core idea. While the app works, the codebase is currently in a huge cleanup phase.

## Current Focus

I am currently working on refactoring and cleaning up the initial AI generated code to make sure the project is stable and maintainable. Because of this:
- Feature requests: I am not accepting new feature contributions at this time.
- Refactoring and cleanup: If you want to help cleaning the codebase, fixing issues or optimizating, feel free to so do! 
- Issues: Please feel free to open an issue if you spot bugs or have suggestions.

This is my first open-source project. If you see something that could be improved in terms of project structure or anything else, I’d love to hear your feedback!
